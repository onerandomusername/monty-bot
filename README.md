## Running Locally

Monty uses quite a few services to run. However, these have been consolidated into the [docker-compose.yaml]() file.

To deploy, first clone this repo.

Minimally, Monty can run with just a bot token, but a few more variables are recommended for a more full experience.

```sh
# required
BOT_TOKEN=

# optional but recommended
GITHUB_TOKEN= # Generate this in github's api token settings. This does not need any special permissions
```

From this point, just run `docker compose up` to start all of the services. Snekbox is optional, and the bot will function without snekbox.

Some services will not work, but the majority will.
